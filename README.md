# Food-Recommendation-System-for-Sugar-Patients-diabetics-
This project aims to build a Food Recommendation System for sugar patients (diabetics), recommending food based on their health conditions, calorie requirements, and blood sugar levels. The system will use machine learning models to predict the best food items suitable for sugar patients.
